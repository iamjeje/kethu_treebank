# Kethu: Indonesian Constituency Treebank
We revised an Indonesian Constituency Treebank created by [Dinakaramani at al (2015)](https://github.com/famrashel/idn-treebank) from Universitas Indonesia and converted it to the Penn Treebank format, the standard in creating the constituency treebank.

The explanation on how and why we convert the treebank can be read in our paper:

*Note.*

*We borrowed the name of [forest on Wonosobo](http://wiki-wisata.blogspot.com/2014/08/hutan-alas-kethu-wonogiri.html), Kethu, as name of our treebank. We choose forest because treebank contains parse tree, as forest contains trees.*

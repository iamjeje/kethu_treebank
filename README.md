## Kethu: Indonesian Constituency Treebank in the Penn Treebank format
We revised an Indonesian Constituency Treebank created by [Dinakaramani at al (2015)](https://github.com/famrashel/idn-treebank) from Universitas Indonesia and converted it to the Penn Treebank format, the standard in creating the constituency treebank.

The explanation on how and why we convert the treebank can be read in our paper:

Then, we made some revision on tagset. The explanation on how and why we did it can be read in our paper:

*Note:*

*We borrowed the name of [forest in Wonosobo](http://wiki-wisata.blogspot.com/2014/08/hutan-alas-kethu-wonogiri.html), Kethu, as name of our treebank. We choose forest because treebank contains parse tree, as forest contains trees.*

### Changelog
Any change we made can be seen in each folder of Kethu.
